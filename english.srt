00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:15,030
FEBRUARY 16, 2096

2
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,450
Early this morning...

3
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:22,240
the JMDF secured a small USNA Navy-affiliated
vessel in Japan's offshore territory.

4
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,740
Apparently, it had begun drifting
because of engine trouble...

5
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:30,410
"SMALL USNA NAVY-AFFILIATED VESSEL
DRIFTING BECAUSE OF ENGINE TROUBLE"

6
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:31,490
but a high-ranking military attaché at
the USNA's Tokyo embassy was aboard the ship,

7
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:34,200
"JMDF CURRENTLY VERIFYING THE FACTS"

8
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:37,120
so the JMDF is currently verifying
all the facts with the USNA military.

9
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,160
It doesn't seem as though
it ran afoul of any poor weather.

10
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,950
Maybe the issue
was with their power source.

11
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,490
After all, with how far automation
has come in this day and age,

12
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:50,240
a simple human error wouldn't have
caused them to lose their steering.

13
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,740
I see. That makes sense.

14
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,620
It's a country's regular army.

15
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,990
This response was too fast...

16
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:05,740
even assuming
our aunt issued a direct order.

17
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:07,660
Which means...

18
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:13,410
their forces were already in position
by the time I contacted her.

19
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:16,040
Well, I'm going to change into my uniform.

20
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,290
Sure, go ahead.

21
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:30,620
Our aunt had already called me
earlier about that news.

22
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:35,450
And yet, I pretended
to be ignorant of the situation.

23
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:41,660
But I don't care if he thinks of me
as a useless sister...

24
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:46,080
if that's what it will take
for him to stay at my side.

25
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:51,990
If it's decided that I can do my job
independently as leader of the Yotsuba,

26
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:55,580
he might leave me.

27
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:00,490
And I'll eventually
have to get married soon enough, too.

28
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:03,700
They'll expect me to have children.

29
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:09,410
Those are the requirements of a candidate
for the next leader of the Yotsuba.

30
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:10,620
But...

31
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:13,240
I don't want that.

32
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:17,580
I don't want anyone
but my brother to touch me.

33
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:24,040
Because...

34
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:27,620
I belong to my brother, body and soul...

35
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:07,700
Pixie... Cancel suspend mode.

36
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,790
What do you require?

37
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:14,160
I want to ask you
about the vampire incidents.

38
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:21,740
First, were the parasites responsible
for the victims' blood loss?

39
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,990
Yes.

40
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:26,490
Why did you need blood
from a living person?

41
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:29,580
Blood loss was not our intent.

42
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:33,240
It was a side effect of mistaken propagation.

43
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,790
Our propagation process starts
by cutting off part of ourselves...

44
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:41,240
and sending it into a recipient.

45
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:45,660
The separate body spreads through blood vessels
while absorbing Psions and Pushions

46
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,620
in the bloodstream.

47
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:51,740
It permeates the recipient's physical body
by exchanging itself for their blood.

48
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:56,870
Wait. You are bodies of information.
You don't have mass.

49
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:00,200
Where does the exchanged blood matter go?

50
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:04,370
It is used to modify their body
during assimilation.

51
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:05,910
Should assimilation fail,

52
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:11,450
the separate body is expelled
from the recipient's body as vitality.

53
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:13,490
So, that's how it works.

54
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:15,910
Should permeation of the body succeed,

55
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:19,620
we can control its information body,
its ethereal body.

56
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,660
An interplay between physical bodies
and information bodies?

57
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:25,330
The same basic tenet as magic.

58
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:29,160
If we can access the recipient's mental body
through their ethereal body and merge with it,

59
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,040
our propagation succeeds.

60
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,660
Unfortunately, however,
we have had no successes.

61
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:36,190
Why not?

62
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:38,330
Unknown.

63
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:40,870
I wanted to know this, as well.

64
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:45,620
For some reason,
the idea alone remains within me.

65
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,740
Before you inhabited that body,

66
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:53,370
you all appeared to move as an organized group
with a common objective in mind.

67
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:58,240
Does one of you correspond
to a leadership position?

68
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,370
There exists no command structure among us.

69
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:08,740
Strictly speaking, each one of us
is not a perfectly autonomous individual.

70
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:11,200
We are both individuals and the whole.

71
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:15,580
We possess the ability to think individually,
but we share our consciousness.

72
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:18,290
Is that how you communicate
with each other?

73
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:20,790
Yes.

74
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:24,040
Where are the other parasites right now?

75
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,290
Current locations unknown.

76
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:31,330
However, I sense their thought waves,
searching for me.

77
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:29,370
We have finally awoken.

78
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:32,830
Chinese necromancy is certainly something.

79
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:38,790
Then, even if our flesh is destroyed,
we can quickly resume activities.

80
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:41,490
Now, we just need to get back
the one who is missing.

81
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:44,160
Let us take back our missing comrade.

82
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:47,870
Let us search for our missing comrade.

83
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,740
Pixie, change into this.

84
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,540
At once, sir.

85
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,660
Brother!

86
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,830
How can you watch that so calmly?

87
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:19,350
Why? Miyuki, Pixie is a robot, you know.

88
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:21,240
She may be a robot,
but she's still a girl!

89
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,370
Well, she may be shaped
like a person, but--

90
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:24,990
It's not right!

91
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:27,660
Please turn around, Brother!

92
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:35,950
It's okay now, Tatsuya.

93
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,370
Pixie, come with us.

94
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:50,240
Yes, Master.

95
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,120
Brother, where are we headed to?

96
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,740
Aoyama Cemetery.

97
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,740
Aoyama Cemetery...

98
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:02,330
I'm sure we're not going there
for an off-season test of courage.

99
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:06,290
Is it just that ghosts
tend to crop up in places like that?

100
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:10,290
You're quick on the uptake. I'm sure
no one will be around to interfere with us.

101
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:14,830
Well, it was something
you thought of, Brother.

102
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:23,660
Um, Tatsuya, it's late,
so won't it be closed?

103
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:26,040
We probably can't get inside.

104
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,490
But if we get close,
they'll come out for us.

105
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:32,660
That's why we brought Pixie along.

106
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:35,540
And if anyone stops and questions us,

107
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:38,040
you'll be here
to do something about it, right?

108
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,040
Please leave it to me!

109
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:47,330
I guess I'll let Leo, Erika and
Mikihiko know where we're going.

110
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:51,150
"THE PLACE IS AOYAMA CEMETERY."

111
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:54,080
VISITOR ARC VIII

112
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,080
Aoyama Cemetery...

113
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,830
The mission begins now.

114
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:13,040
The destination is Aoyama Cemetery.

115
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:13,750
Let's get going.

116
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:14,990
Yes, ma'am!

117
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:20,490
What a huge failure.

118
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:27,620
Excuse me, ma'am.

119
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:28,830
Enter.

120
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,660
There is someone who wishes
to meet with you, Colonel.

121
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,540
Who is it?

122
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,870
Her name is Ayako Kuroba, ma'am.

123
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:43,040
She says she's an agent of the Yotsuba Family.

124
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,950
Yotsuba?

125
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:48,620
The Yotsubas, known and feared
as "Untouchables."

126
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:50,660
What do they want with me?

127
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:55,040
It is an honor to make
your acquaintance, Ms. Balance.

128
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,370
My name is Ayako Kuroba.

129
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:04,040
Colonel Virginia Balance,
USNA military JCS.

130
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:08,450
I know how busy you must be,
so thank you for agreeing to see me.

131
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:10,540
I've come here today to make a request

132
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:16,290
as an agent of Maya Yotsuba, leader of
the Yotsuba Family, one of the Ten Master Clans.

133
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:17,910
Go on.

134
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:21,040
Very well, then.

135
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,990
Colonel, we would like you
to cease the interference

136
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:27,700
with our country's magicians
being carried out at your command.

137
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:35,660
Our leader, Maya Yotsuba, has concerns
over your excessive interference.

138
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:38,740
She said that since our nations
are allied with each other,

139
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:42,830
she did not want to make this affair
into a trigger for any sort of conflict.

140
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:44,700
Is that a warning?

141
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,830
Will you light the trigger if we don't withdraw?

142
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,040
Colonel...

143
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:58,240
Did you sleep well last night?

144
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,290
That was you?

145
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:02,290
What do you mean?

146
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:10,700
Respectfully, your face doesn't look well,
so I simply offered my concern.

147
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:14,830
Colonel, please allow your nerves to settle.

148
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:20,540
If at all possible, we would like to build
a friendly relationship with you.

149
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:23,040
A friendly relationship?

150
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:27,990
You are aware of the power of the Yotsuba.

151
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:33,540
And we are well aware of yours, Colonel.

152
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:37,910
Our leader has said that if you would arrange
to withdraw from this incident,

153
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:44,990
we will not forget
our gratitude to you personally.

154
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:51,160
And that, if there is an opportunity
in the future, we would be able to assist you.

155
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,740
Fine.

156
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,680
JGDF COUNTERINTELLIGENCE DEPARTMENT SECTION THREE

157
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,540
Observation target
currently moving toward the city.

158
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,740
His sister and two others with him.

159
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:11,700
Running video verification with their photos
before getting on the train.

160
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,660
A classmate.

161
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:20,660
Odd tastes, bringing his sister along
on a date like that. Who's the other one?

162
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:23,490
She's not a human.

163
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:27,370
It seems to be a type P94
Humanoid Home Helper.

164
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:30,910
Where could he be bringing it?

165
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:35,700
Chief, the train with the target on it
has changed course.

166
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,950
Akasaka... No, Aoyama?

167
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:42,200
Position operatives disguised
as police officers along Aoyama Road!

168
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:46,540
If the target group uses magic,
pretend to arrest and capture them!

169
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,410
What's wrong, Brother?

170
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:56,700
Someone is spying on us.

171
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:12,200
It feels like Counterintelligence Section Three.

172
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,620
Wh-What am I picking up?

173
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,160
Tatsuya!

174
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:33,700
I put everyone
who was watching us to sleep!

175
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,120
Nice work.

176
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:41,160
Let's get away from here
before their friends come running.

177
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,700
What a troubling young lady.

178
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:56,330
But what splendid skill,
taking down four foes at once.

179
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:59,950
Her name is Honoka Mitsui, right?

180
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:01,830
That's right...

181
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:05,040
Grandfather.

182
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:10,700
Considering her name
and her specialty type of magic...

183
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:14,410
I wonder if she's part
of the Elements bloodline of light.

184
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:24,410
Master, three parasites are approaching.

185
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:26,200
So, they did come.

186
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,410
Tatsuya Shiba, we want to talk.

187
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:47,450
What should I call you?

188
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:49,080
Marte.

189
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:53,910
Then, Mr. Marte, what on earth do you want?

190
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:59,660
We demons have no further intent
to engage in any hostile actions toward you,

191
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,580
the magicians of Japan.

192
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:06,990
In exchange for promising
to end hostilities against you...

193
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:11,240
we want you to hand that robot over to us.

194
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:15,660
Would you mind talking
a little more politely?

195
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:23,120
I don't have any way to answer unless
you explain why you want us to hand it over.

196
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,990
I hadn't thought explanation necessary.

197
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:30,450
In fact, you should have no reason
to take that robot's part.

198
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:32,990
We're the ones who decide
if we have a reason or not.

199
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:39,870
We wish to release our comrade
who is imprisoned inside that robot.

200
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:42,490
Is your comrade not allowed
to have a robot for a host?

201
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:47,160
Our mutual connections
are much stronger than you humans'.

202
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:51,580
Is the fact that we want
to get our comrade, a living creature,

203
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:57,540
out of a lifeless vessel
so difficult for you to understand?

204
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:59,830
No, I understand it.

205
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:01,740
But how?

206
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:04,040
We will destroy the machine.

207
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:10,330
Should the current host be lost,
we can move to a new one.

208
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:11,990
I see.

209
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:14,830
That's his offer, Pixie.

210
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:18,330
Do you wish to be released from there?

211
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:20,120
No, I don't, Master!

212
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,160
I am me!

213
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:27,490
My wish is to belong to you, Master.
That is who I am!

214
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:32,370
I do not care any more
what sort of being I originally was

215
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:37,200
nor where I received
the wish constituting my core!

216
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:42,290
I do not want to stop being me!

217
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:46,950
That's what she says, Brother.

218
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:48,620
Yeah.

219
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:53,700
Anyway, I expect
you can guess our answer already,

220
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:57,870
but before I spell it out for you,
there are two or three things I want to ask.

221
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:01,660
It seems you are more foolish
than we thought, Tatsuya Shiba.

222
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:03,660
We are disappointed.

223
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:07,580
Fine, then.
Say what questions you have.

224
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:10,620
Before, you said
you didn't have any intention

225
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:13,790
of engaging in hostilities
against magicians, right?

226
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:18,700
Why wasn't it against people
instead of against magicians?

227
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,540
If we had accepted your request,

228
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:23,450
you demons wouldn't have
acted hostile toward magicians.

229
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:27,290
Then, how would you act
toward non-magician people?

230
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,790
After you destroyed Pixie's body...

231
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:34,080
what would you have her inhabit next?

232
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,450
Answer me.

233
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:42,990
You possess only superficial cunning
that requires no real wit.

234
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:48,490
We're telling you we won't be your enemies
anymore. Why are you not satisfied with that?

235
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:52,120
We demons are not compatible with humans

236
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:56,660
in the same way that you magicians
are different from other people, am I wrong?

237
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,360
Really, now?

238
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,620
My host was a magician, as well.

239
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:06,740
That is why I understand
the way humans treat magicians.

240
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:11,870
To humans, magicians are tools and lab rats.

241
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:16,160
A magician's wishes are too trivial
for humans to take notice of.

242
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:23,410
Why do you do right by people
who think of nothing more than using you?

243
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:29,120
You have your own wishes
and your own hopes. Don't you?

244
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,910
This all sounds like by-the-book stuff.

245
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:37,870
For someone who just treated me like a fool...

246
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:39,990
you sure are stupid.

247
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,080
You won't harm magicians.

248
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,990
That's fine. It really is.

249
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:52,580
But you've already hurt
my magician friends.

250
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:55,410
Do I have any reason to believe

251
00:19:55,410 --> 00:20:00,450
that you won't hurt them in the future
when you haven't given even a word of apology?

252
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:04,200
It's no different from
the catchphrases that proclaim

253
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,990
to protect a magician's human rights.

254
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:11,240
Come to think of it,
I never gave you my answer.

255
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:14,120
Well, it's "no."

256
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,240
You impudent little...

257
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,120
So easy to understand.

258
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:23,870
I'll make this easy
for you to understand, too.

259
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:29,120
Put down your weapons
and surrender peacefully.

260
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,330
If you do, we won't have to hurt you.

261
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:35,830
I promise you'll be happy lab rats.

262
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:39,620
You... human dog!

263
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:41,410
The signs of magic activation...

264
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:43,240
But...

265
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,870
What?

266
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:04,290
If I destroy his physical body,

267
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:07,700
the parasite will scatter
in search of a different host.

268
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:12,540
If I had Miyuki freeze him with magic,
he'd self-destruct and escape.

269
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:19,700
The parasites don't possess
physical organs but a person's mind.

270
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:23,910
Therefore, there's no real reason
to strike one part of the body over another.

271
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:29,370
So, it's best to strike at the place
most deeply connected to the rest of the body.

272
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,830
Brother!

273
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:07,580
Honoka!

274
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:08,990
I'm all right!

275
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:12,950
After all... I want to...

276
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:15,450
I want to be able to help Tatsuya, too!

277
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,910
That's...

278
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:52,040
VISITOR ARC IX
